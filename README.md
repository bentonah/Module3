# Overview

The software I developed is a text-based adventure game written in C#, showcasing the language's fundamental features and programming principles. The game takes place in an abandoned prison where the player, having been abducted, wakes up in a prison cell with the goal of escaping captivity. The narrative has a mystery/thriller theme, as the player navigates through various locations within the prison, encountering challenges, puzzles, and various decision points. The storyline develops as the player gathers clues, solves puzzles, and collects items that are vital to their escape. The game uses C# features such as object-oriented design, conditionals, loops, file I/O, and error handling to create an immersive and interactive gaming experience.

The primary purpose behind developing this software was to offer a hands-on, practical demonstration of the key features of the C# programming language. By creating a text-based adventure game, the project serves as a great example of the functionality and capability of C#. Through the interactive nature of the game, the game experiements with various language features such as object-oriented design, conditionals, loops, file I/O, and error handling. Using all of these things helped to further broaden my knowledge of C# and the things I can do with it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). This offered a variety of very useful tools, including a code editor, debugger, and project management features, streamlining the development process. It also provided me with various other features that simplified the designing and function of my game.

The primary programming language used for this project was C#. C# was chosen for its object-oriented programming capabilities, making it suitable for structuring the game's complex components, allowing me to create a simple but detailed text-based adventure game. The project did not really utilize any external libraries, instead focusing on demonstrating core C# language features. Standard input/output functionalities were employed for user interactions, and basic file I/O operations were used for saving and loading game progress.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Enhance and improve the storyline/plot. I could add more plot twists, other characters, and various other additional story elements to draw the user in more.
- Graphic/Visual Elements. I could use ASCII art of basic graphics to enhance the visual appeal of the game, perhaps adding images of locations, items, or even characters.
- Additional endings. Although I have two ending options for the game, I could introduce more options that are varied based on the user's decisions throughout the game. This could encourage replayability and strategic thinking.
- Sound Effects/Audio. I could add some audio to the game, such as tense music, muffled sounds, creepy noises, etc.
- Error Handling. Although I have some error handling, I could definitely incorporate more, or make the error messages more unique/varied.
- Scalability. I could try to improve the code slightly by anticipating future changes/additions to it, and design it accordingly to make these changes easy to do.
